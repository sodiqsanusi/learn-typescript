Okay, so with what I've watched at this point, Typescript is not actually another language. It's just an 
addition to Javascript similar to SASS and CSS. It makes your code strictly typed, allows for some new syntax
but is compiled to Javascript at the end to be used in browser's.

First step is to download the Typescript compiler using NPM
```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
This would install the compiler that converts your Typescript code into usable Javascript
